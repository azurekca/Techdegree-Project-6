            | My current position is as a Software Developer at SMRT1 Technologies where We are building smart vending solutions for retail, health services and tourism. Iâ€™m primarily working on front end interfaces using React.
            
            | Previously working as a GIS specialist, I taught myself how to program to solve workflow inefficiencies and discovered I had a passion for coding. I've continued my coding education at Team Treehouse, first by completing the Front End Developer Track and then completing the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. I've also recently completed the full Epic React course by Kent C. Dodds and CSS for JS by Josh Comeau. I'm combining all of my knowledge of data management, effective communication, problem solving and design to make beautiful and functional sites.
